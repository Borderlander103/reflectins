What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a hidden git folder. You need to tell git that you want to start a repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It is a temporary area for holding files you wish to commit. It allows you to set aside only certain files for a commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Good question. Add the logical change to the staging area as you are working on it.
