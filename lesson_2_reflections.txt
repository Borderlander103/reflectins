What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a hidden git folder. You need to tell git that you want to start a repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It is a temporary area for holding files you wish to commit. It allows you to set aside only certain files for a commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Good question. Add the logical change to the staging area as you are working on it.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

For experimental changes and perhaps more involved bugs or feature additions. They allow the main branch to continue undisturbed.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

By giving you a visual of the branch structure.


What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

It combines the changes of two branches. Parents of the commit are from both branches.


What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

On the plus side, it does what should be most of the straightforward merging itself. It also highlights anything it thinks is a possible conflict. On the downside, it doesn't merge everything, and it could merge/overlook a conflict.
