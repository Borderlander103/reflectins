When would you want to create a remote repositiry rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to share or collaborate with others or work from a different computer.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It gives you better control over which and when different branches get shared or go public.
