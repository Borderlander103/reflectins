How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It compared short segments of the file side-by-side for easy comparison.
The better "diff" command actually showed which lines had been added or removed making it even easier.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It would enable to you more easily find errors (and improvements) that have been made along the way.
It can help you remember why you did something.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually having to choose a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

It makes much more sense as you can make logical saves. The challenge is remembering to do it regularly. Perhaps set a reminder to yourself if you tend to forget?

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google docs, treat each file seperately?

Some types of projects, like much of coding, work on multiple, related files at once.
